# Mental navigation task

Analysis of timing errors in mental navigation at multiple speeds

The research question we are asking is how does brain scale mental simulaton in different time scales. Does the scaling dynamics differ for working and episodic memory?

To perform  mental simulation, there are many strategies, among them two strategies are interesting. Firstly, subjects can remember the vector for each target landmark pair and reproduce it. Secondly, the subjects can create a mental map of the landmarks associated with navigation task and simulate through that map to find the optimal path. The second strategy uses a cognitive map, a mental representation of an environment that is used to navigate and understand surroundings. Cognitive maps also  allow visualization of spatial relationship between different location, features within an area or even imagination of new space.   

Through behavioral analysis and psychophysics we aim to identify the subjects who use cognitive maps and learn how they can scale in different time scales.
